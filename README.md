# CRUD App (T3)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/).

## Project Goals

- Gain familiarity with create-t3-app (T3)
- Gain experience using TypeScript, NextJS, tRPC, React Query (via tRPC), Zod, and Prisma
- Gain experience using tRPC API (vs REST API)
- Play around with project architecture (e.g. folders, index.js files, etc.) to improve personal "best practices" (tRPC API)
  - (minimal playing done -- T3 architecture is well done)

## End Goal

- Have improved "best practices" for project architecture (tRPC) + have created any related snippets (for future efficiency)

## Minimal-To-No Concern Given To

- UI
